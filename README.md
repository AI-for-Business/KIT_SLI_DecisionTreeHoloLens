# What is this repository?
This repository contains a program called 'Decision Tree HoloLens', which allows interactive learning with Microsoft HoloLens with the topic of ID3 algorithm for decision tree. It is written in C# language and published under a Creative Commons license. You need to have MRTK 2.7 or above with a compatible Unity version to compile it and deploy it on HoloLens 2.

# What can I use it for?
You can use this software to learn the basic concept of decision tree and ID3 algorithm. The system has four modules, introucing different aspects of the ID3 algorithm in an exploratory approach.

# What do I need in order to use it?
You need to have the MRTK development environment set up to use it. More information can be found in the documentation of MRTK: [MRTK Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk2)
Moreover, you need to have 20 physical objects with (ideally tennis balls) to represent data points.
