# What is this repository?
This repository contains a program called 'Decision Tree HoloLens', which allows interactive learning with Microsoft HoloLens with the topic of ID3 algorithm for decision tree. It is written in C# language and published under a Creative Commons license. You need to have MRTK 2.7 or above with a compatible Unity version to compile it and deploy it on HoloLens 2.

# What can I use it for?
You can use this software to learn the basic concept of decision tree and ID3 algorithm. The system has four modules, introucing different aspects of the ID3 algorithm in an exploratory approach.

# What do I need in order to use it?
You need to have the MRTK development environment set up to use it. More information can be found in the documentation of MRTK: [MRTK Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/mixed-reality/mrtk-unity/mrtk2). 
The main branch of the repository contains the Unity Project (named "Unity Project"), you need to [build and deploy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/build-and-deploy-to-hololens) it on HoloLens. The installed app contains three learning modules and excersies, as well as an introduction.
Moreover, as the inroduction in the application will also remind you, you need to have 20 physical objects (ideally tennis balls) to represent data points.

# Author's note:
You don't need to have physical objects to use the HoloLens application, as the system does not recognize the physical objects. They are included in the instructions for reference purposes.

We have a paper that evaluates this application together with another [Mobile AR](https://github.com/AI-for-Business/KIT_TSC_MobileAR) learning application in a field study, check out [the paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3603555.3608564) if you are interested.
