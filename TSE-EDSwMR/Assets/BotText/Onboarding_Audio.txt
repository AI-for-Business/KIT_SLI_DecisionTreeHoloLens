Hello, my name is Kai. I will guide you on your learning journey to become a Decision Tree Champ. Let’s start our journey.
Have you had any experience with decision trees? 
Please confirm your level of knowledge by pressing the corresponding button.  
To be able to start, we first need all the tools. To start, please take the box labeled “MR: Decision Tree” from the shelf and place it on the table. Tell me if you are ready for the next step.
Great, then let's start with the basics. Do you see the rectangle in the box? Please, place it centrally at the back edge of the table.
Finished?
Now you should see a frame. Move your head to position the frame on the rectangle. Press the button to lock the position.
Open the hand menu by looking at the inside of your wrist. 
Press the “Reset”-button in the hand menu to  reset the frame.  
Congratulations, you have successfully completed onboarding. Now you're ready for the full learning experience. Press “overview” to get started.
