Hello Friend! I love to play tennis. But sometimes the weather is just not well suited for the court. Can you help me decide ? 
!!Let's look at this temperature forecast for tomorrow. If you believe it's fitting for a tennis day choose yes otherwise choose no. // update
!!We also know the weather is supposed to be overcast. What do you think now? !!
There is one more thing we know about this day. It's not gonna be windy[humidity normal] at all. Now that you know all that information about tomorrow, should I go ?
Now this is the forecast for the day after tomorrow.
It's going to be hot. 
And also very sunny.
And oh wow, the humidity will be extremely high, that's probably a sweaty day. In your opinion should I go ?
The oncoming days it'll cool down significantly.
But it's still a nice and sunny day.
And uuuh with normal humidity, it won't feel like a sauna outside.
This is the last day I have time this week the temperature will be mild. 
But it's heavily raining.
And looks like the wind will be a super strong.
