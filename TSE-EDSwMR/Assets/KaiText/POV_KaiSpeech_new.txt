Hello Friend! I love to play tennis. But sometimes the weather is just not well suited for the court. Can you help me decide ? 
Let's look at this temperature forecast for tomorrow. It's expected to be mild
and overcast 
We also know the humidity will be normal. What do you think is it fitting for a tennis day ? Then choose yes otherwise choose no.
Now this is the forecast for the day after tomorrow.
It's going to be hot. 
And also very sunny.
And oh wow, the humidity will be extremely high, that's probably a sweaty day. In your opinion should I go ?
The oncoming days it'll cool down significantly.
But it's still a nice and sunny day.
And not windy at all.     
This is the last day I have time this week. The temperature is expected to be pleasant,
But sadly it will be heavily raining.
And it looks like the tennis ball will be blown a way.
