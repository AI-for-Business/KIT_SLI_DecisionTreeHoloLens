Thank you very much for your help. Now I know when to go play tennis. And I can also use this to decide in the future. I created this decision tree by writing down your choices. 

Look: if I have the forecast for a day, I can use the decision tree to guide me. The new data point goes a long a so called path. 

Its called decision tree because it looks a little like an upside down tree. 

This is the root node.

...and these are called inner nodes. 

And where the tree ends are the leaves. 

In each question you decided on an attribute. For example Temperature or Outlook. 

Thatâ€™s enough theory for now! You already learned the basic structure and terminology of a decision tree.  

A decision tree can also be built with machine learning. You can do that to automize complex, but systematic decisions, so a machine can help you or decide for you. 

Do you want to know how a machine can learn from data to built a decision tree? Then continue in the next module! 


The Nodes on the top are called 'Root', the ones in the middle 'Inner node' and on the bottom are the 'leaves'.
In a question you decide on the value of an attribute.
A decision tree can be built with machine learning. To automize complex, but systematic decisions, so a machine can help you or decide for you.
It's recommended to continue in the next module and find out how to learn from data and how a computer builts a decision tree.
